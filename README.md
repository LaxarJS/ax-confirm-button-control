# AxConfirmButtonControl

A [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)-style button with an additional confirm step for destructive operations, ready for usage as AngularJS directive in LaxarJS applications.

## Installation

To retrieve a copy of this control you can either clone it directly using git or alternatively install it via Bower.
For general information on installing, styling and optimizing controls, have a look at the [LaxarJS documentation](https://github.com/LaxarJS/laxar/blob/master/docs/manuals/installing_controls.md).

### Setup Using Bower

Install the control:

```sh
bower install laxarjs.ax-confirm-button-control
```

Since the only dependency of this control is LaxarJS and assuming that your application is already properly setup, no further configuration is necessary.

Reference the control from the `widget.json` of your widget:
 
```json
   "controls": [ "laxarjs.ax-confirm-button-control" ]
```
