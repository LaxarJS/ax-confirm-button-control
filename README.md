# AxConfirmButtonControl

> A [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)-style button with an additional confirm step for destructive operations, as an AngularJS directive for LaxarJS widgets.


## Installation

To retrieve a copy of this control you can either clone it directly using git or alternatively install it via Bower.
For general information on installing, styling and optimizing controls, have a look at the [LaxarJS documentation](https://github.com/LaxarJS/laxar/blob/master/docs/manuals/installing_controls.md).

### Setup Using Bower

Install the control into your LaxarJS application:

```sh
bower install laxar-confirm-button-control
```

Since the only dependency of this control is LaxarJS, no further configuration should be necessary.
Now you may reference the control from the `widget.json` of your widget:

```json
"controls": [ "laxar-confirm-button-control" ]
```
